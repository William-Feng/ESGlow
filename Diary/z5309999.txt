Week 1:

COMP3900 group formed and named (everyone joined Moodle Team Allocation Group).
We decided to choose Project 8 as it sounded interesting and aligned with our skills.
I was overseas but informed my group that I was happy to be the Scrum Master.


Week 2:

A series of emails were sent out to organise a client meeting, and we all tried to give our inputs to our Team Lead, Carly.
I created our group's repository within the GitHub classroom.
I researched about ESG and brainstormed some key concepts regarding its importance for stakeholders.
During the lab session, we decided on our roles for the upcoming project proposal and discussed the tech stack to be used.
Our group all attended an initial meeting with the client to clarify the project requirements.
For the proposal, I will be in charge of creating the System Architecture Diagram and the Jira tickets once the user stories are ready.
