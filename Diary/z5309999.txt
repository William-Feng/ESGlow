Week 1:

COMP3900 group formed and named (everyone joined Moodle Team Allocation Group).
We decided to choose Project 8 as it sounded interesting and aligned with our skills.
I was overseas but informed my group that I was happy to be the Scrum Master.


Week 2:

A series of emails were sent out to organise a client meeting, and we all tried to give our inputs to our Team Lead, Carly.
I created our group's repository within the GitHub classroom.
I researched about ESG and brainstormed some key concepts regarding its importance for stakeholders.
During the lab session, we decided on our roles for the upcoming project proposal and discussed the tech stack to be used.
Our group all attended an initial meeting with the client to clarify the project requirements.
For the proposal, I will be in charge of creating the System Architecture Diagram and the Jira tickets once the user stories are ready.


Week 3:

Everyone contributed, gave suggestions and worked diligently on the project proposal, which was due at the end of Week 3.
Our 5 team members had meaningful discussions, both consistently in a Messenger group chat and also a check-up in a Discord voice call.
I completed the System Architecture Diagram and provided descriptions, and also populated the Jira backlog as planned last week.
I watched the Lecture recording on behalf of my team, noted down the key points that we had to investigate and led the administrative tasks.
I was also heavily involved with the creation and modification of user stories & epics such that all requirements and novelty features were satisfied.
Being the Scrum Master, I also ensured that the product and sprint backlogs were appropriate, feasible and optimal for this project.


Week 4:

Over Discord, our group members came up with some subtasks or child issues, so that we could better break up the user stories and allocate work.
I setup the PostgreSQL database and created the users table, and tweaked a few attributes together with Sean & Richard as we worked on user registration.
I managed to get Docker to containerise the datbase as I felt it provides great benefits in a team environment, and wrote up a guide on how to get started.
As the Scrum Master, I continually monitored the Jira board, ensuring that the tickets had the correct status and everyone was on track.
I also came up with some Git practices for our team, including having branch protection rules for PRs and commit messages prefixed with the ticket number.
