Attended a meeting with the client and team leads on Friday to finalise 
the proposal before submitting.

Week 4
Worked on setting up the frontend React app, and created the basic UI

Jira and GitHub.

Week 5
Worked on creating the basic UI framework for the dashboard page, 
specifically the company summary and table sections.

Worked on adjusting the sidebar to reflect user changes to metric and 
indicator checkbox selection, and indicator weight modification. 

Week 7
Worked on saving the user selection of the sidebar elements and sending 
it to the data display section of the dashboard to calculate the adjusted 
ESG score. Also refactored the sidebar, modularising the accordion 
components to make the code less cluttered.
